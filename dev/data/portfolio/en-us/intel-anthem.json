Anthem is designed to showcase the more bleeding-edge technological uses of Intel's processing technology and devices.</p><p>The project features a fully responsive site with a landing page containing a self-randomizing grid that encourages users to explore among the available \"stories\". Clicking on a story immerses users in a 3d-accelerated experience that allows them to explore more about people using Intel technology in interesting ways. It is supported on mobile phones, tablets, desktop machines, and in browsers that don't have 3d capability, the 3d experience falls back to a 2d parallax system.</p><p>There's more to this project than meets the eye, however. The site will continue to grow, and therefore required that what typically would be a very rigid, custom build actually be authorable by non-technical client authors via Adobe Experience Manager.</p><p>The Anthem site allows the Intel authors to put any content in, and get a clean result that looks custom regardless of content.</p><p>The phase 1 launch saw the site working all the way back to IE9, and the phase 2 launch supports an expansion of features including filtering by types of content, localizable content (as the experience was designed to go to over 30 international regions), and support for IE8 as well.</p>",
