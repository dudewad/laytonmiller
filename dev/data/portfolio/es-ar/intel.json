My work was to spearhead the global rebranding effort through responsive architecture and sound component design.</p><p>My team completed full transformations of existing components, as well as soup-to-nuts creation from creative and strategic conception to execution on new, interesting components.</p><p>Intel partners with Adobe using their AEM to manage all of their content- past experience served me well in providing not only good code, but also solutions that were flexible, localizable globally, and most importantly, authorable by the client.</p>",
