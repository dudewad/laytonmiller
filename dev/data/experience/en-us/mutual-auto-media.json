	"content": "<p>Mutual Auto Media is a special finance industry lead generation firm based out of Everett, WA. We specialized in connecting used auto dealerships to customers by providing special finance leads from multiple sources of lead generation.</p><p>My role at the company was to build the technology effort. While our products included the usual gamut of marketing materials, websites, and advertising campaigns for a wide range of clients, our heaviest focus was on creating custom lead generation tools and portals to help dealers better understand and capture their demographic.</p><p>The technology used here employed custom data syncing with multiple third party sources, storing and protecting our own data, and funneling and delivering that data to the clients in a digestable manner. We provided a full, end-to-end service from design to development to deployment and dev-ops/maintenance contracts.</p>",
