	"content": "<p>Mutual Auto Media is a special finance industry lead generation firm based out of Everett, WA. They specialize in connecting used auto dealerships to customers by providing special finance leads from multiple sources of lead generation.</p><p>My role at the company was to build the technology effort. While our products included the usual gamut of marketing materials, websites, and advertising campaigns for a wide range of clients, our heaviest focus was on creating lead generation portals to help dealers better understand their demographic. We specialized in driving customers through data portals to capture information and provide better insight on a dealership's customer base and where they come from.</p><p>The technology used here employed custom data syncing with multiple third party sources, storing and protecting our own data, and funneling and delivering that to the clients in a digestable manner. We provided a full, end-to-end service from design to development to deployment and dev-ops/maintenance contracts.</p>",
