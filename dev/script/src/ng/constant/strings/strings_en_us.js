								JAVASCRIPT: {
									NAME: "Javascript",
									TOOLTIP: "Javascript is my bread and butter. I have very solid skills in application building both from scratch as well as from frameworks such as AngularJS."
								},
								HTML: {
									NAME: "HTML",
									TOOLTIP: "While HTML is typically easy for developers to grasp as a concept, writing good, semantic markup that performs for SEO and simultaneously enhances ease of developments across devices is not. As an architect, I pride myself in my skill to see a design's markup pitfalls before I build it."
								},
								CSS: {
									NAME: "CSS",
									TOOLTIP: "CSS architecture is as important as HTML architecture because it has effects on efficiency, maintainability, and functionality in legacy browsers. I have spent my career becoming intimately acquainted with CSS and pride myself in elegant solutions that are cross-browser compatible."

									TOOLTIP: "As a full-stack developer I have led the tech effort for multiple successful startups. I have used PHP as a back-end solution on many successful projects."

								},

									NAME: "Greensock API",
									TOOLTIP: "Why, this very site uses some Greensock to handle animation! It is one of my favorite APIs and I am extremely comfortable using it."
								},
								JQUERY: {
									NAME: "jQuery",
									TOOLTIP: "No explanation required. The word 'ninja' comes to mind, but that would be too clich√© to utter here. Perhaps a 'no duh' will suffice."
								},
								ANGULARJS: {
									NAME: "AngularJS",
									TOOLTIP: "Production projects using AngularJS are both extensible and maintainable. The Microsoft Band online dashboard is a good example of a project where I took a lead architectural role in both its design and development."
								},
								WINJS: {
									NAME: "WinJS",
									TOOLTIP: "When Microsoft launched Windows 8, they launched a whole new platform for authoring apps as well. I worked on multiple Windows applications that were delivered to over 60 countries worldwide, interacting with millions of people."
								}
							}
						},
						PROCESS: {
							TITLE: "Process",
							ITEMS: {
								VCS: {
									NAME: "Version Control",
									TOOLTIP: "Git, SVN, TFS. I'm well versed in various flavors of version control, and it forms the backbone of my work. I utilize advanced work flows such as commit hooks to send data to third parties such as Slack or Jira to reduce development effort automatically."
								},
								AGILE: {
									NAME: "Agile",
									TOOLTIP: "I am comfortable working in sprints and using scrum best practices to enhance the development process. I have led or been on Agile/scrum teams for major projects like the Intel global rebrand, Microsoft Band Online Dashboard and Xbox.com's launch of the Xbox One properties."
								},
								SCRUM: {
									NAME: "Scrum",
									TOOLTIP: "Experience with Jira, YouTrack, and Bugzilla. I regularly lead scrum triages with my teams and am fluent in managing backlogs, sprints, etc. I understand how to manage incoming work that is not part of a sprint and the effect it has on the current workload. It is my aim to become a CSM in the near future."
								}
							}
						},
						TOOLING: {
							TITLE: "Tooling",
							ITEMS: {
								GRUNT: {
									NAME: "Build Tools",
									TOOLTIP: "Front-end build tools have become a de-facto standard for development. I have embraced them fully and have even provided the national Razorfish team with a new standard recommendation on Grunt usage process."
								},
								CSS_PREPROCESSORS: {
									NAME: "CSS Pre-processors",
									TOOLTIP: "SASS and LESS are now considered a standard, and I am fluent with both. Beyond that, I have what I like to consider a sophisticated opinion about what makes good CSS pre-processing architecture."
								},

							ITEMS: {
								CROSS_DISCIPLINE: {
									NAME: "Cross Disciplined",
									TOOLTIP: "Bridging the gap between creative, UX, BD, DM, dev, QA, and dev-ops takes more than a little knowledge of each silo. My experience across agencies, startups, and sole-proprietorships has given me that knowledge, and it benefits me every day."
								},
								CLIENT_MANAGEMENT: {
									NAME: "Client Management",
									TOOLTIP: "A good developer is one thing. A developer who can talk to non-technical parties is another."
								},
								TEAM_MANAGEMENT: {
									NAME: "Team Management",
									TOOLTIP: "Leading a team requires loyalty from those around you. I believe that loyalty can only be garnered through respect. I respect my co-workers, no matter where they sit in the organization."
								},
								PROJECT_SCOPING: {
									NAME: "Project Scoping",
									TOOLTIP: "Knowing how long a project can take before it starts takes big-picture thinking based on real-world experience. Realistic scoping is a skill one can only learn by trial and error. I have done my fair share."
